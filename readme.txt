### Key Features of User Registration
* **Easy Drag and Drop Builder:** Simply drag and drop the form fields into a blank slate and create a registration form in no time. No code, no fuss.

* **Custom Form Fields Apart from Default User Fields:** User Registration removes the limitations posed by the default WordPress fields while registering users. Use custom form fields like Country, Privacy Policy, and Profile Picture to design any kind of form you need.

* **Email Notifications for Users:** Send customized email notifications to your users as soon as they complete the registration process. Additionally, you can send notifications regarding payments and changes made to profile details as well.

* **Beautiful User Profile Account Page:** User Registration automatically creates a WordPress user profile account for all your registered users. Even better is the fact that you’re still in complete control of the customization of this page.

* **In-built Login Form:** No need to make a separate login form for users as you get an in-built login form with User Registration. Just redirect your users to this page from the registration page.

* **Strong Spam Protection with Google reCaptcha and Honeypot:** Block spam attacks like fake user registration and spam submissions with our Google reCaptcha and honeypot feature. Just enable the features for selected forms from the plugin settings.

* **Assign User Roles and Capabilities:** Assign default WordPress user roles like Editor, Author, Subscriber, and more while creating registration forms. This lets you control who has access to which sections of your website and what actions they can perform.

* **[Premium] [Multi-Step Form:](https://wpeverest.com/wordpress-plugins/user-registration/multi-part/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ur-upgrade-to-pro)** Long and detailed forms can look dull and crammed. That’s why we’ve created multi-step forms that let you break long forms into multiple sections for a cleaner and engaging presentation.

* **[Premium] Collect Payments via Credit Cards and PayPal:** User Registration works flawlessly with both [PayPal](https://wpeverest.com/wordpress-plugins/user-registration/payments/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ur-upgrade-to-pro) and [Credit Cards(Stripe)](https://wpeverest.com/wordpress-plugins/user-registration/stripe/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=ur-upgrade-to-pro).
