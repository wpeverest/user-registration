## Code of conduct

User Registration has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read [the full text](https://github.com/wpeverest/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Coding Guidelines

- **Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/)**
- Install our pre-commit hook using composer. It'll help with the Coding Standards. To install run `composer install` from the command line within the user-registration plugin directory.
- Ensure you use LF line endings in your code editor. Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) if your editor supports it so that indentation, line endings and other settings are auto configured.
- When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
- Ensure that your code is compatible with PHP 5.4+.
- Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the master branch of the User Registration repository. Existing maintenance branches will be maintained by User Registration developers.

Please **don't** modify the changelog or update the .pot files. These will be maintained by the User Registration team.

## Translating User Registration

We have a [project on translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/user-registration). You can join the localization team of your language and help by translating User Registration. [Find more about using joining a language team and using GlotPress](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/).

If User Registration is already 100% translated for your language, join the team anyway! We regularly update our language files and there will definitely be need of your help soon.

### Glossary & Style Guide

Please refer to this page on the [Translator Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/glossary-style-guide/) for information about the glossary and the style guide.

We maintain the User Registration glossary [on this shared Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LlTmZLSuAyrJD_rHCsPY0ofCB1h1OT45SXFNU_a8ki8/edit?usp=sharing). You can use it as a template for creating your own glossary.
Please download the file by going to **File > Download as > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet)** and save it on your computer/Mac. Open it with your favourite CSV editor (or re-upload it on your own Google Drive) and edit it.

Make sure to edit the second column’s header by using your own language’s code (eg. for Italian you would use `it`, for Portuguese (Brazil) you would use `pt-BR`).

Write the translated entry in this column and translate the entry description as well.
Don’t change other columns headers and value, but feel free to add new entries.

When your CSV is ready, import it on GlotPress.

_**Warning**: Importing a CSV does not replace existing items, they will be created again. We suggest to import them only when first creating the glossary._

Each translation editor will take care of updating the glossary on GlotPress by editing/adding items when needed.

_**Note**: Only editors can create/import and edit glossaries and glossary items on GlotPress. Anyone can suggest new items to add to the glossary or translate them._

**Style Guides Available**

We don’t have a Style Guide template available, so feel free to create your own. If you created a style guide for your language, please let us know so we can add it in the list above. You can also add it by yourself by submitting a PR for this file.
