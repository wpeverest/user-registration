 * stepped past, or every spec becomes flaky on a schedule nobody controls.
 *
 * The wp-admin check first is not an optimisation. Playground — the engine CI
 * boots — runs with `--login`, which authenticates a browser context as admin
 * on its first request to the site. Driving wp-login.php on top of that races
 * the auto-login's own redirect, and the loser is `#wpadminbar`: one CI run
 * failed here with "element(s) not found" and passed on retry, which is what

/**
 * A browser context that really is a logged-out visitor.
 *
 * `browser.newContext()` is not one. Playground boots with `--login`, and that
 * flag logs EVERY new context in as admin on its first request — so a spec that
 * opens a "visitor" context, registers an account through the front end and
 * then expects the My Account login form is handed the admin dashboard instead.
 * The failure surfaces as `input[name=username]` never appearing, which reads
 * like a broken login form rather than like a session that was never anonymous.
 * Worse than the red: `settings-security.spec.ts` asserts that a subscriber
 * keeps the admin bar, and an admin session satisfies that for the wrong reason.
 *
 * So the auto-login is allowed to happen once and then undone. The WordPress
 * auth cookies are dropped and Playground's own
 * `playground_auto_login_already_happened` marker is kept — keeping the marker
 * is the whole trick, because clearing every cookie just invites the next
 * request to log the context straight back in.
 *
 * On a normal WordPress there is neither a marker nor an auth cookie to drop,
 * so this is an extra page load and nothing else. `baseURL` is passed
 * explicitly because a context built from the `browser` fixture does not
 * reliably inherit the one in `use`.
